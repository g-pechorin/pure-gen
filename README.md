This is a WIP project.

This is a partial "dump" of my ["monorepository"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) containing everything to run the/my "pure-gen" Virtual Human system.

Maybe someday, I'll elabourate here ... but for the time being that's not a useful expenditure of effort.

# `fud14.pure-gen.sbt/`

This is the/my prototype system.

# `peterlavalle-minibase.sbt/`

This is a shameful pile of "base code" that I swear I'm going to iron out and remove at some point.
Just ignore it.

# `sbt.bin/`

These are Scala/SBT settings I share across my projects.
Just ignore them.

# `.hg`

This is a marker for eventually back-tracking from [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/g-pechorin/pure-gen/issues) and/or [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/g-pechorin/pure-gen/pulls) to the original commit.
Please don't edit it.
