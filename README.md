This system demonstrates using [the pure functional programming language PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/) to ["script" (in the Unity3D sense)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html) the interactions between components to make an interactive AI.
For the time being - there are only speech recognition and speech synthesis components.
This project is a "architectural" demonstration.

[Installation Instructions](INSTALL.md) provide a guide to ensuring that the system "installs" on your PC.

[A long-winded tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) is intended to walk a non-FP person through constructing a crude system with this.
