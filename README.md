This is a copy of the/my PhD project containing everything to run the/my "pure-gen" Virtual Human system.

- [`fud14.pure-gen.sbt/`](fud14.pure-gen.sbt/)
	- This is the/my prototype system.
	- This is the focus of this repository
- [`peterlavalle-minibase.sbt/`](peterlavalle-minibase.sbt/)
	- This is a shameful pile of "base code" that I swear I'm going to iron out and remove at some point.
	- Just ignore it.
- [`sbt.bin/`](sbt.bin/)
	- These are Scala/SBT settings I share across my projects.
	- Just ignore them.
- `.hg`
	- this file marks where I exported the sources from
	- again - ignore it, it's needed for my config to work
		- ... and explaining it is simpler than removing it
